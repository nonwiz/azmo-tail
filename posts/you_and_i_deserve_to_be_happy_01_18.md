Hi friends,  
Are you feel alone now? Do you feel like you do not have friends or are left out sometimes? If yes, I feel the same also.   

Recently, I realized that actually, I don’t have that thing that we call as BFF. I saw a lot of posts on social media that are about friends. In the Instagram account like travel together with the caption “best friends forever”. To be honest, I want to do the same, but the reality is that I just do not have any. Recently I also feel that I am being left out from a group of friends that I thought that we are friends but actually we are not.   

There’re many times that they invite me to go travel or plan to go on a trip together but in reality, when the actual time comes, I am the one who is always being left out. In my opinion, I have really tried my best to out from my safe zone to fit with them, but all my effort is for nothing.   

Dear friends, if you are feeling the same as I am, I want to let you know that you deserve to be happy. It is true that everyone needs friends to accompany each other but the moment you are working so hard to be accepted to their standard, trust me it is better to be alone.   

Alone.   
Alone sometimes is not that bad. Recently, I went to travel to Krabi, Thailand with my special one, his friends, and coworker. That first, I thought that I will feel alone, but I did not. I figure out that, even though I am alone I do not feel alone instead I learn to be happy and see what the world has. I can have my personal moment with nature, sitting under the sun and space in my mind. I do not have to give my attention to others or overthink about what consequences can happen "if I want to be alone, will they think I am antisocial?"   

It is okay to be alone. Alone does not mean you are alone. Let’s look at the positive side.   

We are more likely to have time to ourselves. We have all the time to study, personally grow separately in financial, work, beauty, belief, mental and physical.   

We are more likely independent being alone. Since we are used to doing everything by ourselves, we are more likely independent than usual.   

We are more likely to appreciate ourselves than usual people. Since we use to do everything by ourselves, we learned to appreciate ourselves by rewarding ourselves for what we have achieved.   

Remember:   
we deserve to be happy. Never compare ourselves to other people. Others' life might seem more colorful than ours, but remember we are the real pencil color. We must use power to make our paper look either rainbow or stormy. Whether we choose to be happy or sad, you and I deserve to be happy and I choose to be happy.
