# Latter for 2021: Happy New Year 2022

If you ask me what I regret about 2021, I will say. I admit that I had regretted listening too much to what others thought of me and what they had to say about me. In 2019, I heard that these guys are slandering me. Since then, I've tried to isolate myself till I gained weight and lost my self-assurance. 

Is this making me feel better? So far as I recall, I believe I had. Every day, I convinced myself that simply isolating myself in my room would make me feel better and prevent those people from gossiping about me. So, because I didn't accomplish anything, I'm guessing there's nothing to talk about, right? Is that really how it went down? 

Those people are always talking about something. No matter how hard I try to avoid them, they always find something to talk about, even if it's something as minor as bacteria. 

What am I sorry for? I'm sorry that I listened to them; I'm sorry that I let them ruin my chance to be happy. 

I've decided to take a brief trip to Krabi in 2021. Whether I like it or not, I have a tendency to overthink things. What if, what if, what if, what if, what if, what if, what if, what if but  as soon as I saw the view, I was astounded by how God had orchestrated my arrival at this precise moment to enjoy His creation. 

Dear friends, if you are reading this and are now locked up, or if you are being victimized by people who believe they are doing better than you, please try to step outside and see what God has in store for you. 

My December 2021 was one of the most memorable months of my life. I've tried so many new things that I had no idea what I was capable of. Nature, a new journey, new experience, new passion, and new talent have all helped me to just appreciate every moment. 

It is not too late to begin a fresh chapter in the year 2022.  

*Greetings in the year 2022.*  
*Love, Azmo.*
